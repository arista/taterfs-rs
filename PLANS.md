# Plans

This document tracks the roadmap and planned features for taterfs-rs.

## Current Focus

Look at the changes in [merge.md](./docs/architecture/merge.md) on this branch, particularly the changes are around conflicts.  Part of this can be implemented now, but some of it requires further discussion.

Prepare a plan for implementing the conflict directory representation

Offer an opinion on:

* how the "take" script should be implemented
* what approach to take with conflicts (as outlined in "conflict discussion")

## Planned Features

## Completed

## Ideas / Backlog

- Set up LocalStack or MinIO for S3Backend integration tests
- Look into running expensive computations (hash/crypto) in separate threads
