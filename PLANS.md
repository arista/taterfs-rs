# Plans

This document tracks the roadmap and planned features for taterfs-rs.

## Current Focus

I think I missed something in the repo+branch grouping, which is that all the items in that group also need to have the same base commit.  I may have also mistaken the logic for multiple overlapping groups, saying that they should be modifying commit 2 instead of commit 1.  I've added to sync.md, hopefully correcting those.

## Planned Features

## Completed

## Ideas / Backlog

- Set up LocalStack or MinIO for S3Backend integration tests
- Look into running expensive computations (hash/crypto) in separate threads
