# Plans

This document tracks the roadmap and planned features for taterfs-rs.

## Current Focus

cli.md introduces the notion of a CommandContext, and imposes a different way of handling specifying repository specs, filestore specs, and paths.  The existing CLI needs to be changed to confirm, and use the CommandContext

## Planned Features

## Completed

## Ideas / Backlog

- Set up LocalStack or MinIO for S3Backend integration tests
- Look into running expensive computations (hash/crypto) in separate threads
